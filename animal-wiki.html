        <h1>Giant tortoise</h1>

        <p>Diego, a tortoise more than 100 years old, is credited with helping to restore the tortoise population in the Galapagos Islands, where a 40-year breeding program on Española Island has just wrapped up.

          The Giant Tortoise Restoration Initiative, led by the Galapagos National Park Directorate and the Galapagos Conservancy, began in 1965 with the aim of repopulating the islands’ threatened tortoise species. At the time, only 14 tortoises — two males and 12 females — lived on Española Island.

          Diego returned from the San Diego Zoo to his island of origin in 1976 to join the original population in a captive breeding program. On Friday, the initiative's director, Washington Tapia, said there are 2,000 tortoises on the island.

          "The island has sufficient conditions to maintain the tortoise population, which will continue to grow normally — even without any new repatriation of juveniles," Tapia said in a statement.

          And Diego gets a lot of the credit; he is believed to be responsible for 40 percent of the island’s newly repatriated tortoises.

      <h1>'Zombie Snake' Plays Dead When Threatened</h1>
      <img src="img/snake.jpg" alt="snake">
      <p>A snake that can fake its own death is going viral in the United States. The North Carolina State Parks and Recreation posted some pictures of the unusual snake on their Facebook page asking its followers to guess the snake's species as part of their Year of the Snake celebrations.
        When threatened the snake species known as Heterodon platirhinos, or more commonly the eastern hog-nose snake, flips on its back, pokes out its tongue and even emits a rotting odor. This is a part of the snakes complex defense mechanism it uses to avoid becoming another animals dinner.

      <h1>'An incredibly important species': How wombats help other wildlife survive bushfires</h1>
      <img src="img/wombat.jpg" alt="wombat">
      <p>Wombats have been allowing other endangered animals into their homes as they flee fire-torn bushland.
        Animals have survived the bushfires by fleeing into underground tunnels set up by wombats.
        The tunnels have become a refuge for species like wallabies and echidnas, as they shelter from the fires.
